    "The recommended workflow for developing a Moonshot strategy is to start in a notebook, where you can develop your code interactively, then transfer the finished code to a `.py` file for backtesting. (This approach is described in more detail in the [usage guide](https://qrok.it/p/moonshot-interactive-dev).) Once you've transferred your code to a `.py` file, you can continue to debug your strategy interactively using the technique described in this notebook. The basic technique is to open the `.py` file in JupyterLab and attach a console for interactive exploration. "

    "The debugging steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your Moonshot strategy file [umd.py](../moonshot/umd.py) in the JupyterLab editor.\n",
    "2. Right-click in the file and select \"Create Console for Editor\"\n",
    "3. Select the entire contents of the file (Ctrl+A on Windows or Cmd+A on Mac), then click Ctrl+Enter to load the file contents into the console.\n",
    "4. In the Console window, instantiate your Moonshot strategy and name the variable `self`. Here, we are exploring the `UpMinusDownDemo` strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self = UpMinusDownDemo()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Load prices for the desired date range by calling your strategy's `get_prices` method (this method is defined on the `Moonshot` base class):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prices = self.get_prices(start_date=\"2017-01-01\", end_date=\"2017-02-01\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To debug `prices_to_signals`, select the body of the method (everything excluding the method definition at the top and the return statement at the bottom), then click Shift+Enter. This copies the selected lines to the console and executes them. Normally the `prices` variable is passed as a parameter to `prices_to_signals`, but in this case we already loaded a `prices` variable in the previous step, so the executed code uses that.\n",
    "7. At this point, all the local variables from the `prices_to_signals` method are loaded in the console and can be inspected interactively.\n",
    "8. This process can be continued to explore additional methods like `signals_to_target_weights`. Since both a `signals` variable and `prices` variable are now loaded in the console, you can select and execute the body of `signals_to_target_weights` and it will use those variables. You can then inspect the variables created in `signals_to_target_weights`. \n",
